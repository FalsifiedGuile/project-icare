Notes for Management Meeting

------------------------------

SUMMARY

- 40 agencies want to report anonimized data to CCS
- agencies will have access to their own data
- we create a system for them to add/update data in CCS system
- we also create a reporting system for CCS to create reports

------------------------------

- sending data to a third party, non government agency CCS
- dont trust CCS with nonanonimized data
- still want to be able to update data

2 different sections
- upload section for agencies
- report generation section for CCS

reports generated by CCS
- all agencies are included in 1 REPORT
- pull from public data for percentages (800 iraqi immigrants in the system, how many NOT in the system)
- trends (MoM/YoY)

- anonymize their data (derived general location from postal code)

- database will have a unique (anonimized) key for each user, so that agencies can update without giving away who the user is

- each agency can see all information about their own user

- agency adds initial data, gets a unique identifier
- agency can update data based on that unique identifier, updates gets pushed to our system
- our system is anonymized
- agencies have all their data to themselves and can search/find agency IDs for users to update
