Meeting Minutes with Ben Cooper

TA meetings are Mandatory
-	Every team member needs to participate – each will at least have to answer a question
-	Last time people would just randomly answer a random question
-	Be generally aware of the deliverable
 
 
Wednesday every week at 6 pm will be our TA meeting
 
-	Every other week is interview meeting about deliverable just submitted – those are marks, rubrics are marked, deliverable grades released at the same time
-	Interview meetings will have  short feedback and a mark

-	Check up weeks – other, not marked, won't be marked – let ben know
 
-	Next week is a deliverable meeting, meet after that – we would be quizzed after that
