As Adam, an Agency Clerk, I would like to use an intuitive template form submission, just like excel, to fill out my client's information so that it is not any more time consuming than the current process of filling out the iCare excel template.
Frontend
* Application with working buttons and forum submission 2 + 2 story points 1 (Jacq)

As Adam, an Agency Clerk, I would like my form submission to have error prevention (needing valid postal code, names can not be empty, etc...)
